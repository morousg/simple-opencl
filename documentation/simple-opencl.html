1.0.1   Motivation and description
SimpleOpenCL is a library written in ANSI C and born in the needs of scientific
research test development.  It has been originated while developing different
OpenCL codes for Linux and Apple test machines, with single device perfor-
mance and portability goals in mind.  The main goal of SimpleOpenCL has
been reducing the code needed to run the experiments on the GPU, but also
supports managing CPU devices. As this is an open source project, we welcome
any contribution, from code correction and functionality suggestions/contribu-
tions to documentation or even contribution system proposals.
    The main author have created and uses this library for its projects and aims
to share it with those who want to use OpenCL with C or C++ for experimental
codes in any sector. Nevertheless we think this can be an interesting library for
academical purposes.  With SimpleOpenCL the teacher can for instance focus
on teaching Device code. And if desired later on the teacher could either show
the library code to teach basic OpenCL Host code or propose student&#8217;s to do
more technical improvements over it or both.
    We are not aiming to provide a CUDA-like interface for OpenCL, but there
will be some similarities.  The main author proposes a CUDA-like library for
OpenCL as a separate and more production oriented project.
1.1   History
SimpleOpenCL is a library written in ANSI C and born in the needs of scientific
research test development.  It has been originated while developing different
OpenCL codes for Linux and Apple test machines, with single device perfor-
mance and portability goals in mind.  The main goal of SimpleOpenCL has
been reducing the Host code needed to run OpenCL C kernels on the GPU, but
also supports managing CPU devices.
    In a sentence:  **The only thing a programmer needs to know in order to
use SimpleOpenCL is C, two SimpleOpenCL types, and a minimum of three
                                                               2                                                   

            
                                                                                                                   
            functions**. Device code (OpenCL C kernels) is exactly the same as in OpenCL.

   And this is without printing the names of the error flags, that would add a
large function.

Roadmap
2.1   SimpleOpenCL Version 0.010 27/02/2013
   &#x2219; v1 Incremented with increased functionality up to a certain goal or amount
       of changes (new functions)
    &#x2219; vv2 Incremented with bug corrections and functionality additions.
    &#x2219; date Set at the date of bug correction or any v1 or vv2 level modification.
2.2   Actual version 0.08
   &#x2219; Non finished but working version. A first finished version is scheduled for
       version 1.0
    &#x2219; It provides two structs to simplify the handling of OpenCL objects. They
       are conceptually grouped in hardware and software.
    &#x2219; It provides simplified Device memory allocation and copy functionalities.
    &#x2219; It also provides a function that creates a list of devices using the &#8221;clHard&#8221;
       struct for each device, and creates a context for that devices. The context
       will be the same for same type and same memory capacity devices. If any
       of those differ, then different contexts will be created for each device.
    &#x2219; Other functions select the desired devices from the list.
    &#x2219; In order to get information of OpenCL errors, there is a function that
       prints the OpenCL error flags returned by the OpenCL functions.
    &#x2219; Functions to load Device source code, compile it etc are present.
    &#x2219; Functions to enqueue or execute kernels, etc...
                                                               8                                                   

            
                                                                                                                   
                &#x2219; A main 1.0 version goal is already implemented as &#8221;sclManageArgsLaunchK-
                 ernel&#8221;.   It  can  with  only  host  pointers,  sclHard  and  sclSoft  variables
                 NDRange dimensions and a string containing the info of what to do with
                 the pointers etc, execute the kernel and update the results on the host
                 pointers. All in a single function call.
2.3   Next version
Goals for version 1.0:
   &#x2219; All hardware selection functions must use the sclGetAllHardware function
     first if a list of hardware is not passed as an argument and it has NULL
     value. Then, the functions must return the desired hardware following the
     function criteria expressed in its own name.
   &#x2219; The sclManageArgsLaunchKernel can/must be improved in the following
     ways:
  1. Optional: a version that hides sclHard and sclSoft so the user only cares
     about which host pointers will be read and written from the device in
     OpenCL C code and which to use exclusively on the device.   Nothing
     else.  Think of when to initialize hardware?  Possibly needing a global
     variable pointing to the sclHard and sclSoft objects to avoid repeating the
     software/hardware initialization process on each kernel execution.
  2. Mandatory:  the function must have the ability to schedule work across
     all the devices available. So maybe the function will need more info from
     the user to know which data can be partitioned, and which can not. The
     possibility of internally using something similar to GMAC would be won-
     derfull.   Pagination of the pointers in my opinion is the most efficient
     automatic method to do that work, but repeating a work already done
     would be frustrating.
                                                               9
